# TASK1
GADE6112
As far as task 1 of semester 2 is concerned, I found this assignment very difficult.
Using what we learned from Semester 1 helped a lot, but when incorporating all the things we learned from this semester, it seemed pretty daunting.
One of the many problems I've faced in the assignment is the way the questions were phrased, as they were very challenging.
